# Contract maintenance and governance

A Compact contract is not frozen once deployed. Its on-chain entry points (the circuits
it accepts calls for) and the party allowed to change them can both be updated after the
fact. Midnight calls this **contract maintenance**, and the controlling party is the
contract's **maintenance authority**.

You reach for this when you:

- **rotate a ZK setup** — recompile a circuit and swap its verifier key,
- **add a circuit post-deploy** — insert a verifier key for an entry point that didn't
  exist at deploy time,
- **retire a circuit** — remove a verifier key so calls to that entry point stop
  verifying,
- **hand over control** — replace the authority that is allowed to do any of the above.

This document describes the on-chain mechanics (independent of any SDK), how the
TypeScript reference SDK ([midnight-js](https://github.com/midnightntwrk/midnight-js))
exposes them, and how **this** SDK exposes them — including why a contract is ungovernable
unless you opt in at deploy. For where governance sits in the broader provider model, see
[midnight-js-comparison.md](./midnight-js-comparison.md); for the signing-key store it
relies on, see [private-state.md](./private-state.md).

## The on-chain model

Every contract's `ContractState` carries two things that matter here (types live in
`midnight-onchain-state`, re-exported through `midnight-bindgen`):

```rust
// the entry points, each holding a verifier key
operations: HashMap<EntryPointBuf, ContractOperation>,

// who may change them, and the replay/threshold guard
maintenance_authority: ContractMaintenanceAuthority,
```

```rust
pub struct ContractMaintenanceAuthority {
    pub committee: Vec<VerifyingKey>, // the n public keys allowed to authorize updates
    pub threshold: u32,               // k — how many of them must sign
    pub counter: u32,                 // monotonic replay guard
}
```

So the authority is a **k-of-n committee**. The signatures come from
`base_crypto::signatures::SigningKey` (Schnorr over secp256k1); each committee member is
the `VerifyingKey` of one such key. midnight-js only ever uses the **1-of-1** case
(`committee = [vk]`, `threshold = 1`), but the ledger supports full k-of-n.

## What you can change: `SingleUpdate`

An update is a list of `SingleUpdate`s (from `midnight-ledger`'s `structure` module),
applied **in order** within one signed batch:

```rust
pub enum SingleUpdate {
    ReplaceAuthority(ContractMaintenanceAuthority),
    VerifierKeyRemove(EntryPointBuf, ContractOperationVersion),
    VerifierKeyInsert(EntryPointBuf, ContractOperationVersionedVerifierKey),
}
```

- **`VerifierKeyInsert`** adds a verifier key for an entry point. It **does not replace**
  an existing one — the doc comment on the variant is explicit: *"This operation does not
  replace existing keys, which must first be explicitly removed."* So "rotate a key" is
  `VerifierKeyRemove` then `VerifierKeyInsert`, which can be batched into one update.
- **`VerifierKeyRemove`** drops the key at an entry point + version.
- **`ReplaceAuthority`** swaps in a new `ContractMaintenanceAuthority`.

`EntryPointBuf` is the circuit name (the same key under which `ContractState.operations`
stores the verifier key). The current version tag is `ContractOperationVersion::V3`, and
the verifier key is wrapped as `ContractOperationVersionedVerifierKey::V3(VerifierKey)`
where `VerifierKey` is `transient_crypto::proofs::VerifierKey`.

## How an update is authorized: `MaintenanceUpdate`

The batch is wrapped in a `MaintenanceUpdate` and attached to an `Intent` (alongside any
other actions) via `Intent::add_maintenance_update`:

```rust
pub struct MaintenanceUpdate<D> {
    pub address: ContractAddress,
    pub updates: Array<SingleUpdate, D>,
    pub counter: u32,
    pub signatures: Array<SignaturesValue, D>, // SignaturesValue(committee_index: u32, Signature)
}
```

Construction is `MaintenanceUpdate::new(address, updates, counter)` followed by
`.add_signature(idx, sig)` (which keeps the signatures sorted). Each committee member
signs the **same** payload, produced by `data_to_sign()`:

```text
b"midnight:contract-update:" || serialize(address) || serialize(updates) || serialize(counter)
```

i.e. `SigningKey::sign(rng, &update.data_to_sign())`, attached at the member's committee
index.

### Validation rules (the ones that bite)

From `MaintenanceUpdate::well_formed` in `midnight-ledger`'s `verify` module
(verified against ledger 8.1.0):

1. **Signatures sorted, strictly increasing by index.** `sigs[i].index < sigs[i+1].index`
   — no duplicate signers, no out-of-order entries. Otherwise `NotNormalized`.
2. **Replace-authority must bump the counter.** Any `ReplaceAuthority(new_auth)` in the
   batch must have `new_auth.counter == update.counter + 1`. Otherwise `NotNormalized`.
3. **Every signer must be in the committee.** `committee[idx]` must exist, else
   `KeyNotInCommittee`; and `vk.verify(data_to_sign, sig)` must hold, else
   `InvalidCommitteeSignature`.
4. **Threshold must be met.** `signatures.len() >= authority.threshold`, else
   `ThresholdMissed`.

The `counter` is the replay guard: it is part of the signed payload, and the authority's
counter advances by one each time an update applies. Reusing a stale counter invalidates
the signatures (they were computed over a different `data_to_sign`).

## Guaranteed vs. fallible: a governance tx can "succeed" and still not apply

Maintenance updates run in the transaction's **fallible** phase (see
[dust-and-fees.md](./dust-and-fees.md) and
[intents-and-zswap-mechanics.md](./intents-and-zswap-mechanics.md) for the two-phase
model). The consequences are the same as for contract calls:

- A malformed update (bad signatures, missed threshold, wrong counter) is rejected up
  front — the transaction is **not included**.
- A well-formed update that fails to apply — inserting a key that is **already present**
  (`VerifierKeyAlreadyPresent`) or removing one that is **not found**
  (`VerifierKeyNotFound`) — lands in a block as a **partial success**. Fees are paid and
  no maintenance change takes effect.

So "the tx made it into a block" is not "the key rotated." You have to check the
chain-side `TransactionResult` afterwards (this SDK exposes
`MidnightProvider::wait_transaction_result` for exactly that).

## How midnight-js exposes it

All in `packages/contracts/src/governance/`. The shape is uniform across the three
operations: assert the contract state, **load the signing key** from the private-state
provider, build the `MaintenanceUpdate`, sign, submit, and throw unless the final status
is `SucceedEntirely`.

| Operation | Function | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Insert VK | `submitInsertVerifierKeyTx(providers, compiled, addr, circuitId, newVk)` | Asserts the circuit is **not** already defined. `newVk` is **caller-supplied** bytes. |
| Remove VK | `submitRemoveVerifierKeyTx(providers, compiled, addr, circuitId)` | Asserts the circuit **is** defined. No VK input. |
| Replace authority | `submitReplaceAuthorityTx(providers, compiled, addr)(newAuthority)` | Curried. On success, **overwrites** the stored key. |

There are also ergonomic wrappers — a per-circuit `CircuitMaintenanceTxInterface`
(`insertVerifierKey` / `removeVerifierKey`) and a contract-level
`ContractMaintenanceTxInterface` (`replaceAuthority`).

### The signing key is established at deploy

This is the part that makes governance work end-to-end. `deployContract` takes an
**optional** `signingKey`; if you don't pass one it samples a fresh key:

```ts
signingKey: deployContractOptions.signingKey ?? sampleSigningKey()
```

That key is fed into the contract constructor (as a `KEYS_SIGNING` config entry), which
is what builds the initial `ContractState` with `committee = [verifyingKey]`,
`threshold = 1`, `counter = 0`. After a successful deploy the key is persisted under the
new contract's address:

```ts
await providers.privateStateProvider.setSigningKey(contractAddress, signingKey);
```

Every later governance op loads exactly that key with `getSigningKey(contractAddress)`,
so the deploy and its maintenance ops share one authority. `replaceAuthority` additionally
overwrites the stored key with the new one on success — and midnight-js's own comment
flags the crash-recovery gap: if the process dies between submit and `setSigningKey`, the
on-chain authority and the locally-stored key diverge.

The "pass your own key" path exists so two contracts can share a maintenance authority.

The actual `ContractMaintenanceAuthority` construction (deriving the verifying key,
setting the threshold) lives in the closed-source `@midnight-ntwrk/compact-js` package,
not in midnight-js itself.

## Using it in this SDK

### The default deploy is ungovernable — on purpose

This SDK's codegen has no compact-js constructor logic, so the generated
`InitialState::build` hardcodes the default authority:

```rust
// crates/compact/compact-codegen/src/expand/ledger.rs
ContractState::new(
    StateValue::Array(/* ... */),
    StorageHashMap::new(),
    ContractMaintenanceAuthority::default(), // committee: [], threshold: 1, counter: 0
)
```

`ContractMaintenanceAuthority::default()` is an **empty committee with threshold 1**. By
the validation rules above, no `MaintenanceUpdate` can ever satisfy it: you can never
collect one valid signature from a zero-member committee, so `ThresholdMissed` (or
`KeyNotInCommittee`) is unavoidable. A contract deployed this way is permanently frozen.

This SDK keeps governance **opt-in and key-custodial-free**, which differs from midnight-js
in two ways: it never assigns an authority you didn't ask for, and — more importantly — it
**stores no signing key**. You set the committee (public keys) at deploy; every maintenance
op is signed externally, by whoever holds the committee keys, and you submit the
transaction with the collected signatures. That makes real k-of-n committees work without
the SDK ever touching a member's secret key.

### Opt in at deploy

`with_maintenance_authority` takes the committee (verifying keys) and a threshold:

```rust
// Single-owner contract (1-of-1): you keep `authority`, the SDK only sees its public half.
let authority = SigningKey::sample(rand::thread_rng());
let contract = Contract::deploy(provider)
    .with_initial_state(state)
    .with_zk_keys("compiled/counter")
    .with_maintenance_authority(vec![authority.verifying_key()], 1)
    .await?;

// k-of-n: collect the members' public keys, pick a threshold.
.with_maintenance_authority(vec![vk_a, vk_b, vk_c], 2)
```

This sets `committee`, `threshold`, `counter = 0` in the deployed state. Nothing is stored
and no private-state provider is required — the committee members keep their own keys.

The committee is validated before it goes on-chain: it must be non-empty with
`1 <= threshold <= committee.len()`, else deploy errors with `ContractError::Maintenance`.
This rejects two footguns the ledger itself would accept: `threshold > committee.len()` (or
an empty committee), which is permanently un-maintainable; and `threshold == 0`, which the
ledger treats as "zero signatures required" — i.e. anyone could govern the contract. The
same validation applies to the new committee in `replace_authority`.

### Run maintenance ops

Maintenance lives behind a sub-builder. Because signing is external, an op is a three-step
flow: **prepare** (build the unsigned update), **sign** (each member signs the same bytes),
**submit**. You can chain several operations on one builder — they go into **one signed
update, applied in order, atomically**:

```rust
let contract = Contract::at(provider, address).build();

// Single op (1-of-1 convenience): prepare, sign locally, submit.
let vk_bytes = std::fs::read("compiled/counter/keys/increment.verifier")?;
contract.maintenance()
    .insert_verifier_key("new_circuit", vk_bytes)
    .prepare().await?      // fetch counter + build unsigned update
    .sign(0, &authority)   // sign data_to_sign() with the committee key at index 0
    .await?;               // build + submit -> PendingTx

// Batch: rotate a verifier key atomically (insert never replaces, so remove
// first — both land in one transaction).
let new_vk = std::fs::read("compiled/counter/keys/increment.verifier")?;
contract.maintenance()
    .remove_verifier_key("increment")
    .insert_verifier_key("increment", new_vk)
    .prepare().await?
    .sign(0, &authority)
    .await?;

// Hand control to a new committee.
contract.maintenance()
    .replace_authority(vec![new_vk_a, new_vk_b], 2)
    .prepare().await?
    .sign(0, &authority)
    .await?;
```

The batch precondition check simulates each step in order, so `remove("x")` followed by
`insert("x", ..)` is valid even though a lone `insert("x", ..)` on an existing circuit is
not.

For a **k-of-n** committee, distribute the bytes to sign and collect signatures out of band:

```rust
let prepared = contract.maintenance().remove_verifier_key("increment").prepare().await?;
let payload = prepared.data_to_sign();           // send to each member
// each member: let sig = their_key.sign(&mut rng, &payload);
let pending = prepared
    .add_signature(0, sig_from_member_0)
    .add_signature(2, sig_from_member_2)         // any >= threshold members, by committee index
    .await?;                                     // build + submit
```

`prepare()` fetches the current authority `counter` (the update must carry it) and runs the
precondition check (`insert` fails if the circuit already exists; `remove` fails if it
doesn't). The returned [`PreparedMaintenance`] exposes `data_to_sign()` (the exact bytes a
member signs), `add_signature(index, sig)` (attach an externally-produced signature at the
signer's committee position), and `sign(index, &key)` (the local convenience). `.await`
builds + submits (returning a `PendingTx`); `.build().await` returns the proven bytes
without submitting. The signed update rides the same dust-balancing path as a deploy.

Before building, the attached signatures are checked against the committee captured at
`prepare()`: indices must be **distinct** and in range, each signature must **verify** over
`data_to_sign`, and the count must meet the threshold. A duplicate index, an out-of-range
index, a wrong-key signature, or too few all fail here with a specific
`ContractError::Maintenance`, rather than after paying to build and submit a transaction the
chain would reject. At most one `replace_authority` is allowed per update (a second would
silently overwrite the first on apply).

**Confirming success.** Like any contract action, a maintenance update runs in the fallible
phase: a *well-formed* update (valid signatures, threshold met, correct counter) is included
even if its effect can't apply — e.g. inserting a key for a circuit that was concurrently
defined lands as a *partial success* (fees paid, no change). So `.await` returning a
`PendingTx` that reaches a block does not by itself prove the rotation applied; confirm with
[`MidnightProvider::wait_transaction_result`](../crates/midnight-provider/src/provider.rs)
if you need certainty.

Replacing the authority does **not** touch any local state — the SDK has none. The new
committee's members keep their new keys; pass their verifying keys to `replace_authority`.

### Read the current committee

`Contract::maintenance_authority()` returns the on-chain `ContractMaintenanceAuthority`
(committee, threshold, counter). A member uses it to find the index they sign at:

```rust
let authority = contract.maintenance_authority().await?;
let my_index = authority
    .committee
    .iter()
    .position(|vk| *vk == my_key.verifying_key())
    .expect("not on the committee") as u32;
// ... prepared.add_signature(my_index, my_key.sign(&mut rng, &payload)) ...
```
